Third project for android developer Nanodegree.
In this project, I had to productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state.
This consisted of handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization,
adding widgets, and adding a library.


The initial commit consists of starter code provided by Udacity.
